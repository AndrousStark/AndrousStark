# Hi, I'm Aniruddh Atrey (he/him)

I'm a developer focused on cybersecurity, systems, and practical machine learning. I like building tools that probe, measure, and harden systems—then documenting what I learn along the way.

## What I work on

- Cybersecurity tooling
  - StealthWeb-Enumerator: DNS/dir enumeration, virtual host discovery, file enumeration, and basic VAPT workflows bundled into one Python tool
  - Port Scanner: Python-based scanner demonstrating network probing techniques and reporting
- Machine Learning for Security
  - Network Intrusion Detection using ML: feature engineering + supervised models to detect anomalous traffic, with a focus on reproducible evaluation
- Systems and Algorithms
  - Gator-Taxi (C++): data structures and scheduling logic in a performant workflow
- GitHub experiments and fun
  - Contribution-history generator and YOLO/Pull-Shark achievement sandboxes

## Recent activity highlights

- Polishing portfolio projects for clarity and reproducibility
- Expanding security tooling coverage (enumeration depth, reporting)
- Streamlining ML baselines and metrics for intrusion datasets

## Skills

- Languages: Python, C++
- Domains: Cybersecurity, VAPT, Networking, ML for Security, Systems Programming
- Tools: Git/GitHub, basic pentest workflows, data pipelines, reproducible experiments

## Selected projects

- StealthWeb-Enumerator
  - Web recon toolkit for DNS/dir enumeration and vhost discovery with modular scanners and basic result summaries
- Network Intrusion Detection using ML
  - End-to-end pipeline: preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation for traffic anomalies
- Port Scanner
  - Practical scanner with timing controls and reporting to support recon phases
- Gator-Taxi (C++)
  - Algorithmic problem-solving and data-structure–heavy implementation

## How I work

- Reproducibility first: scripts, seeds, and clear READMEs
- Measurable outputs: metrics, reports, and benchmarks
- Security mindset: threat surfaces, least privilege, and safe defaults
